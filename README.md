Employee Management System

This project is a comprehensive Employee Management System developed using Java and JNI. It interfaces with LDAP through C++ code, running within the JVM, to provide CRUD operations and hierarchical tree structures for efficient management of employee data within an Active Directory environment.

Features

	•	LDAP Integration: Interacts with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) through C++ code, ensuring seamless integration with Active Directory.
	•	CRUD Operations: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing employee records.
	•	Hierarchical Tree Structures: Organizes employee data in hierarchical tree structures for efficient management and navigation.
	•	Java Native Interface (JNI): Utilizes JNI to bridge the Java codebase with native C++ code, enabling seamless interaction between the two environments.

Technologies Used

	•	Java
	•	JNI (Java Native Interface)
	•	C++
	•	LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
