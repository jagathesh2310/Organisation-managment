# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a comprehensive solution developed using Java and JNI to manage employee data within an Active Directory environment. It interfaces with LDAP through C++ code, running within the JVM, providing CRUD operations and hierarchical tree structures for efficient management.

## Features

- **LDAP Integration:** Seamlessly interacts with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) through C++ code for integration with Active Directory.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing employee records.
- **Hierarchical Tree Structures:** Organizes employee data in hierarchical tree structures for efficient management and navigation.
- **Java Native Interface (JNI):** Utilizes JNI to bridge the Java codebase with native C++ code, enabling seamless interaction between the two environments.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JNI (Java Native Interface)
- C++
- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
